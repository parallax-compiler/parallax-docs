# ADR-001: Project Name and Branding

**Date**: 2025-12-22  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: @fedres

**Context**: The project needs a memorable name that communicates its purpose and differentiates from the existing `vkStdpar` header-only library.

**Decision**: The project will be named **"Parallax"** with the tagline *"Parallel Algorithms, Universal Acceleration."*

**Rationale**:
- "Parallax" (PARallel ALgorithms with unLX acceleration) is a meaningful acronym
- Evokes the idea of seeing the same code from different perspectives (CPU vs GPU)
- Available across package managers and social platforms
- Professional sound suitable for enterprise adoption
- Clear differentiation from `vkStdpar` (runtime+compiler vs header-only)

**Consequences**:
- GitHub organization: `parallax-compiler`
- Social media: `@ParallaxCompiler`
- Package names: `libparallax`, `parallax-clang-plugin`
